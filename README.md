# Mock-Bank-App
A console application which mimics a typical bank application. The user can do the following: Deposit, Withdraw, Check balance, Change pin, Check transaction history.

As this is a tester application, a new 'account' cna be made by typing in a username which is not already on the system. New users will automatically have the pin number '0000'.
Currently, user accounts are stored as 2 .txt files (one stores the current balance and the other stores the pin number) and a .csv file (which holds the transaction history). These files start with the username, which is currently used to check if their is an account created.
